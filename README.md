# N-Queen Visualizer

This is an interactive visualizer for solving the N-Queens problem, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The visualizer allows users to see the backtracking algorithm in action as it solves the N-Queens problem on an NÃ—N chessboard.

## Demo

You can try out the visualizer live at the following URL:
[**N-Queen Visualizer**](https://ervg0203.github.io/N-Queen-Visualizer/)

## Features

- **Interactive Chessboard**: Adjust the size of the board to solve the N-Queens problem for different values of N.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch the algorithm place queens on the board step by step.
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Visualizes the backtracking technique used to solve the problem.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To create the structure of the chessboard and the interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the chessboard and controlling the layout.
- **JavaScript**: To implement the backtracking algorithm and animate the solution process.
